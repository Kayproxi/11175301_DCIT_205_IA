        <p>Below are some of the courses and their description.</p>

        <h3><u><b>DCIT 101 Introduction to Computer Science</u></b></h3>
        <p>This course provides a broad survey introducing the key areas the computer science discipline
          and information technology discipline. It introduces computers and how they work, their
          classification and historical development. Topics covered will include Application of
          computers; Data representation in Computers; Peripherals; Files; Systems Engineering;
          Databases; Computer architecture; Assembly language; Data Communications and
          networking; Systems software; Programming concepts in very accessible language Python;
          Algorithms and data structures; The internet and Web Technology. Programming assignments
          are inspired by real-world domains of cryptography, forensics, gaming and finance.</p>

        <h3><u><b>DCIT 102 Computer Hardware and Circuits</u></b></h3>
        <p>It provides comprehensive understanding of the essential components associated with
            computers with a focus on PCs. Topics include: The microprocessor, motherboard, memory,
            graphics and sound adapters, I/O devices storage and circuit theory. An overview of operating
            systems and other software, as well as the various methods used to connect computers to each
            other and the Internet, are presented. The course also addresses recent advances in computer
            architectures and computer hardware and how they affect computer performance.
            Presentations of actual hardware are included so that students can gain experience in
            identifying the various internal and external components of a PC.</p>

        <h3><u><b>DCIT103 Office Productivity Tools</u></b></h3>
        <p>This course teaches use of office productivity tools. Microsoft Office 2016 software products
              Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint will be taught in depth. Topics include: Word–
              creating documents text editing, formatting, saving, and printing, creating table of contents;
              commenting tools, proofing, tracking; Excel- creating spreadsheets, data entry, formatting,
              formulas, functions, tables and performing calculations on data, charts and graphics, dynamic
